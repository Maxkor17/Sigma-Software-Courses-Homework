The year is 1906, 
the date         November 16th.
Franz and UlrikeSchumacher
and their three           children have just               disembarked from the Hamburg-Amerikaline steamship that has carried them across thestormy North Atlantic Ocean from Germany.
Like the thousands           of other
people milling aroundthem, they are totally           bewildered, caught up in a mixtureof hope and apprehension, as they crowd into a vast waitingroom.
The room sounds like the Tower
of Babel, for few of thosein it          speak a word of English.
They speak German,            Polish, Dutch, Hungarian, or Russian maybe, yet they have come,
seeking a new life ina           new world; and now they are on     American soil for the first time.
This          is America! America! Or at least it is          Ellis Island.
After interminable             hours of waiting, the       Schumacher family
arefinally            called to a desk; immigration officials study         their papers,and ask them where they intend to go.
They don't              ask how long they're       planningto stay,
however,            since they know the answer       already.
All those      who pass     through Ellis Island - and
that could       mean over 11,000 people per       day - are would-be immigrants.
They are looking             to start a new life in a 
new world.
For many, passing through Ellis        Island was not so
much a matter              of stepping into a new world, it was stepping into a new            life, a new character.
And so it was           that the man who finally
led his family        through the door and onto the          ferry packed with a jostling crowd       of new Americans was not Franz
Schumacher      any more, but Frank Shoemaker, even if he         still didn't understand more      than a couple of words of English.
