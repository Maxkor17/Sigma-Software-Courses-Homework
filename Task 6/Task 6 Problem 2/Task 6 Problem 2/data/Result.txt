The year is 1906, the date November 16th.
Franz and UlrikeSchumacherand their three children havejust disembarked from the Hamburg-Amerikaline steamship that has carried them across thestormy North Atlantic Ocean from Germany.
Like the thousands of otherpeople milling aroundthem, they are totally bewildered, caught up in a mixtureof hope and apprehension, as they crowd into a vast waitingroom.
The room sounds like the Towerof Babel, for few of thosein it speak a word of English.
They speak German, Polish, Dutch, Hungarian, or Russian maybe, yet they have come,seeking a new life ina new world; and now they are on American soil for the first time.
This isAmerica! America! Or at least it is Ellis Island.
After interminable hours of waiting, the Schumacher familyarefinally called to a desk; immigration officials study their papers,and ask them where they intend to go.
They don't ask how long they're planningto stay,however, since they know the answer already.
All those who pass throughEllis Island - andthat could mean over 11,000 people per day - are would-be immigrants.
They are looking to start a new life in a new world.
For many, passing through Ellis Island was not somuch a matter of stepping into a new world, it was stepping into a new life, a new character.
And so it was that the man who finallyled his family through the door and onto the ferry packed with a jostling crowd of new Americans was not FranzSchumacher any more, but Frank Shoemaker, even if he still didn't understand more than a couple of words of English.
